package org.ripunjai.TwoSum;

//Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
//You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
//You can return the answer in any order.

//Example 1:
//Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
//Output: [0,1]
//Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
